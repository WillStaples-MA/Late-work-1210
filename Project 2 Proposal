the software that you will use.
-	R

the type of data you will work with.
-	Numerical Likert responses 

how you will clean/restructure your data, 
-	The data from each participant will need to be separated and placed into 4 specific vectors.

how you will visualize your data.
-	Ggplot, single bar graph containing the 4 vectors.


Project 2: Will Staples

I plan to use R to clean, restructure, and visualise my data. The study data I hope to use this code with will be continuous self-report 
numerical data grouped into 4 nominal categories. For data cleaning, I will ensure the data collected is all numeric. 
This is a precaution but is likely unnecessary as the code from project 1 does not allow non-numeric responses and does not allow responses 
outside the established response range (1-7). The data will be restructured so that all data from each condition 
(each participant undergoes 12 or 24 trials) will be in one of 4 vectors: PI, DI, BP, or BA. I will then visualise this data in a single 
bar graph with the nominal categories (PI, DI, BP, or BA) as the a-axis, and the continuous self-report data on the y-axis.
