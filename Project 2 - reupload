##Project 2: Will Staples

#I plan to use R to clean, restructure, and visualise my data. 
#The study data I hope to use this code with will be continuous self-report numerical data 
#grouped into 4 nominal categories. For data cleaning, I will ensure the data collected is all numeric. 
#This is a precaution but is likely unnecessary as the code from project 1 does not allow non-numeric 
#responses and does not allow responses outside the established response range (1-7). 
#The data will be restructured so that all data from each condition (each participant undergoes 12 or 24 trials) 
#will be in one of 4 vectors: PI, DI, BP, or BA. I will then visualise this data in a single bar graph 
#with the nominal categories (PI, DI, BP, or BA) as the a-axis, and the continuous self-report data on the y-axis.
